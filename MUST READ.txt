Improved Unlockables by: Rampage, Metal Venger1, lotomot0, ak2yny for all of his help and advice, Enchlore for Hank Pym unlockable, Huge thanks to all of the X Voice contributors and the modding community as I have included many modded characters from MarvelMods to be unlockable with this mod.

--- IMPORTANT ---
1. It is worth noting that this mod is compatible with OCP and 50/36 Roster hack mods. Naturally, with these mods installed, your game will automatically unlock all characters but this mod (Improved Unlockables) reverses that so that you can unlock many vanilla/modded characters through story progression.
2. This mod is compatible with Outsider's EXG mod. Install Improved Unlockables after installing EXG, if using Mod Organizer 2 then place Improved Unlockables below EXG.
3. If you don't want your characters locked but still want unlockable achievements, use the unlock all characters cheat code.
4. Link to view all character and achievement unlocks - https://1drv.ms/x/s!AkAKCMK6BqYixmCcUbQHNSdKfDw1?e=MVtf4u
